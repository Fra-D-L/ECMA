# Problem

Suppose the recovery time for patients taking a new drug is measured. A placebo group is also used to avoid the placebo effect. The data are as follows:

```{r}
x <- c(15, 10, 13, 7, 9, 8, 21, 9, 14, 8)
y <- c(15, 14, 12, 8, 14, 7, 16, 10, 15, 12)
```

We want to compare the means of the two groups to verify whether they are equal or not.   
Verify the t-test assumptions, and then proceed with the t-test if appropriate. Which is the corresponding non-parametric test? Perfom it and compare the results to the one obtained with the t-test.

# Solution

```{r}
# normality test

# with a qqplot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
qqnorm(x); qqline(x, col="red")
qqnorm(y); qqline(y, col="red")

# with the Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(x)
shapiro.test(y)
```


```{r}
# homogeneity of variances
var(x)/var(y)
var.test(x,y)
```

```{r}
#t-test
t.test(x,y,
       paired = FALSE,
       var.equal = TRUE,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```

```{r}
# non parametric test
wilcox.test(x,y,
            paired = FALSE,
            alternative = "two.sided")
```
