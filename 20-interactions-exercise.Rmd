# Exercise

We now consider the dataset from air pollution studies, on the sulphur dioxide concentration.

```{r}
pollution <- read.table("data/sulphur.dioxide.txt", header=TRUE)
```

First, fit a regression model to the data, including quadratic terms for the predictors.

Second, consider the inclusion of interaction terms as well.
Include interactions for the following variables:

* Wind:Rain
* Wind:Wet.days
* Population:Wind
* Temp:Wet.days
* Temp:Wind

# Solution 

```{r}

```
