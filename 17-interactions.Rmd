# Problem
(source: Crawley, The R book)

Our example comes from a farm-scale trial of animal diets.
There are two factors: diet and supplement.

Diet is a factor with three levels: barley, oats and wheat.

Supplement is a factor with four levels: agrimore, control, supergain and supersupp.

The response variable is weight gain after 6 weeks.

```{r}
weights <- read.csv("data/growth2.txt", sep="\t")
head(weights)
```

Perform an analysis of variance including a factor for the interaction between diet and supplement.

# Solution

```{r}

```
