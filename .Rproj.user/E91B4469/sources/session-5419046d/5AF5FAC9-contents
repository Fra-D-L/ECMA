# Exercise 1

Consider the dataset `Weight_birth.csv`. We wish to explain the variability of child weight at birth as a function of characteristics of the mother, of family history and of behaviour during pregnancy. The dependent variable is weight at birth (quantitative variable `BWT`, expressed in grammes). The independent, explanatory variables include the weight of the mother (`LWT`, quantitative variable), the age of the mother (`AGE`, quantitative variable), and the smoking status of the mother (`SMOKE`, factor with two level, 0/1).
Fit a regression model using these variables and comment on the results. Then fit a second model, excluding the variable `AGE`. Compare the two models using the function `anova()` and commenting on the R-squared values. Which is the best model?


```{r echo=FALSE}
dati <- read.csv("data/Weight_birth.csv", sep="\t")
head(dati)
```


# Exercise 2

Consider the dataset `Weight_birth.csv`. We wish to explain the variability of child weight at birth as a function of characteristics of the mother, of family history and of behaviour during pregnancy. The dependent variable is weight at birth (quantitative variable `BWT`, expressed in grammes). The independent, explanatory variables include the age of the mother (`AGE`, quantitative variable), and the smoking status of the mother (`SMOKE`, factor with two level, 0/1).
Fit a regression model including an interaction effect between these variables, plot and comment on the results. Then fit a second model, excluding the interaction term. Compare the two models using the function `anova()` and commenting on the R-squared values. Which is the best model?


```{r echo=FALSE}
dati <- read.csv("data/Weight_birth.csv", sep="\t")
head(dati)
```
