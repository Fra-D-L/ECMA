# Problem

We consider one of the data sets available with R relating to an experiment into plant growth. The purpose of the experiment was to compare the yields on the plants for a control group and two treatments of interest. The response variable was a measurement taken on the dried weight of the plants.

```{r}
data(PlantGrowth)
plant.df = PlantGrowth
plant.df$group = factor(plant.df$group, labels = c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))
```

* The data set is called **plant.df**. Have a look at it and visualize its structure.
* Produce a side-by-side boxplot to visually compare groups.
* Are the treatments different to the control group? To investigate these differences, fit a one-way ANOVA model (check for normality of the dependent variable prior to model fitting).
* Compare the results to those obtained with a regression analysis and comment on the output.

# Solution

```{r}
str(plant.df)
```

```{r}
hist(plant.df$weight)
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(plant.df$weight)
qqnorm(plant.df$weight); qqline(plant.df$weight)
```

```{r}
boxplot(weight ~ group, data = plant.df)
```



```{r}
mod <- lm(weight ~ group, data = plant.df)
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
plant.df$group <- relevel(plant.df$group, ref="Treatment 1") 
mod <- lm(weight ~ group, data = plant.df)
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
summary(aov(weight ~ group, data=plant.df))
```


```{r}
anova(lm(weight ~ group, data=plant.df))
```
