# Problem

Load the data set **cats** from the "MASS" library, which contains information on various anatomical features of house cats.

```{r catsdata}
library(MASS)
data(cats)
```

"Bwt" is the body weight in kilograms, "Hwt" is the heart weight in grams, and "Sex" should be obvious. There are no missing values in any of the variables.

* Have a look at the data set.
* Plot a data (scatterplot of Bwt and Hwt)
* Are "Bwt" and "Hwt" correlated? Test for correlation - use the Pearson correlation coefficient.
* Does "Hwt" depends on "Bwt"? Plot the regression line and then use appropriate plots to check for model assumptions.
* Comment on the diagnostic plots.

# Solution

```{r}


```
